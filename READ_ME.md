# JavaScript Lesson 1.3 Template - Greeting Program

### Welcome! 
Note: If you are coding along with the video, we suggest you open the video a window on the left and this repl.it template opened in a window on the right. This method of coding along is called "split screen".


#### Using this template, you will be able to practice the following:
- Code a `for loop` that performs a repetitive task.
- Use a JavaScript method to make our counter variable     `i` visible in our `for loop`.
- Usea `for loop`to calculate the sum of a set of          numbers.



#### Get Started:
- On the left menu click on the file named "script.js" to get started.
